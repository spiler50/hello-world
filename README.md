# hello-world
Just another Hello World repository

Hi, My name is Tobias Johansen.
This is the First time i created a Github Repository.
I now this is cheesy and VERY beginner like.
But hey every one has to start somewhere right?...Right?
Well back to more awesome code learning. Not that i am actually good at this.
But hey it is fun and i learn a lot.

PS: To the people who problebly things create a hello world github is dumb. You should really try it.
You may actually learn something ;-)
